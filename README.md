# sutthisan #

A lightweight, node.js/express server for Open Web Apps.

## Installion @@

First, you'll want `node` and `npm` installed. See
[nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) for more information.

You can download a zip of sutthisan and use it as your app template. You can
also do a git checkout then delete the `.git` folder so you don't have its
history polluting your own.

Then just `npm install` to install the required npm packages.

If you plan on using redis you'll need that installed on your system,
obviously.

### Copy and Paste Install Instructions ###

    git clone https://github.com/tofumatt/sutthisan.git
    cd sutthisan
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    npm install
    node app.js

You'll likely want to rename the app folder, of course.

## What's with the name? ##

It's pronounced "Sue tae san".

It's named after สุทธิสาร (Sutthisan), my old MRT station in Bangkok. I just
like the name and the sound of the word. You can even
[see it on Google Maps](http://goo.gl/maps/DnE7N)!
